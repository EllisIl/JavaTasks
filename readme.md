# Overview

As a software engineer, I aimed to deepen my understanding of Java by creating a task management application. This software allows users to manage tasks with features for adding, editing, deleting, and filtering tasks by category. The project focuses on reinforcing programming skills in Java syntax, data structures, and file handling.

The purpose was to enhance my Java skills and create a functional tool for task management.

# Development Environment

I developed the software using IntelliJ IDEA. The programming language is Java, utilizing core libraries like `java.util` for collections and `java.io` for file operations.

# Future Work

Future enhancements include:

- **User Authentication**: Adding a login system for task management.
- **GUI Development**: Creating a JavaFX interface for better usability.
- **Task Prioritization**: Implementing features for task priority and due dates.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Adding more filtering options by date and status.
- **Unit Testing**: Writing tests to ensure reliability.

These improvements will further enhance the application and my development skills.
